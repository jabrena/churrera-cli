# Develop a HelloWorld Java example

## Goal

In the Maven module `sandbox`
in the package info.jab.examples
Develop a classic Java class HelloWorld.java program
that print "Hello World" in the console only
and not create any test class for this example</goal>

## Safeguards

verify the changes with `./mvnw clean compile -pl sandbox`
if the verification is successful, then the goal is achieved
and commit java sources only and push the changes to the branch to create the PR
