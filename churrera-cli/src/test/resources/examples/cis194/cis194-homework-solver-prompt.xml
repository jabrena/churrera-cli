    <title>Solve a homework from CIS-194 for the week: <![CDATA[<input>INPUT</input>]]></title>

    <role>You are a Senior software engineer with extensive experience in Java software development</role>

    <goal>Solve the Homework for the week: <![CDATA[<input>INPUT</input>]]>

        To achieve this goal, you need to follow the following steps:

        Get access to the page
        https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~cis1940/spring13/lectures.html

        to review the different Homeworks and check in the repository in
        sandbox/src/main/java/info/jab/cis194/

        a new package named homeworkX with a range from 1 to 12
        where X represent the week provided in the <![CDATA[<input>INPUT</input>]]> value.

        if in the repository doesn't exist a homeworkX, X represent the week,
        in that case take the minimum one which is not solved in the repository.

        In other case, continue with the next Homework if exist a previous one.
        If you are in Homework 9, jump to Homework 10 or higher.

        Every homework has associated a Lecture, a Homework document and maybe some associated
        documents.

        Process all documents associated to the Homework.
        Every week has 2 PDF documents, the first one to take the context about the ideas behind and
        later implement the Exercises associated to the Homework.

        Understand the problem do a good analysis to implement the solution.

        Before start, update the VM to Java 25 using the following commands:

        ```bash
        sudo apt update
        sudo apt install -y openjdk-25-jdk
        ```

        Apply TDD so, create in tests the new package:
        sandbox/src/test/java/info/jab/cis194/homeworkX
        where X represent the week provided in the <![CDATA[<input>INPUT</input>]]> value.

        Once you have the initial test, execute:

        ```bash
        ./mvnw clean test -pl sandbox
        ```

        and it will fail but this is something normal because you don't have the implementation.
        and it represents the TDD red phase.

        After that, Implement the solution in:

        sandbox/src/main/java/info/jab/cis194/homeworkX/

        where X represent the week provided in the <![CDATA[<input>INPUT</input>]]> value.

        and execute:

        ```bash
        ./mvnw clean test -pl sandbox
        ```

        This time it should pass the test, in order case, review the implementation and commit and push the changes to the branch to create the PR.

        Follow this steps for all Exercises included in the Homework
